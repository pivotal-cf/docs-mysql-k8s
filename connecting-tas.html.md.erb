<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic demonstrates how to connect an application running on VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS) to a <%= vars.product_full %> instance.

## Prerequisites

Before you can connect an application running on TAS to a MySQL instance, you must have:

* The Kubernetes Command Line Interface (kubectl) installed.
For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

* Installed <%= vars.product_short %> on a Kubernetes cluster that supports a form of external ingress, for example, via a `LoadBalancer`.

* An application that is deployed to Tanzu Application Service and can access the Kubernetes cluster ingress points.

## <a id='binding-an-application'></a> Binding an Application

To bind a MySQL instance to an application running on TAS:

1.  Deploy an instance of <%=vars.product_full %> that uses a public ingress method, such as `LoadBalancer`.
1. Enable TLS for the instance, following the instructions in [Configuring TLS for MySQL Instances](./configure-tls.html).
1.  Create a database and least-privilege MySQL user for the application, following the procedure [Create a Database and Privileged MySQL User for the App](./connecting-apps.html#create-app-db).
1.  Set environment variables for your newly created user and for the load balancer hostname:

    ```bash
    export HOSTNAME=$(kubectl get service mysql-sample  -o 'jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip}')
    export USER=bn_wordpress
    export PASSWORD=hunter2
    export DATABASE=for_my_app
    ```
1.  Create a credentials hash for a TAS user-provided service configuration:

    ```bash
    cf create-user-provided-service k8s-tanzu-sql -p "{\"uri\":\"mysql://$USER:$PASSWORD@$HOSTNAME:3306/$DATABASE?reconnect=true&sslMode=required&ssl_mode=required\"}"
    ```

As with any data service, the application will automatically connect to the database instance if this is supported by the buildpack that the application uses. If
the buildpack does not support autoconnect, you will need to manually use the `uri` service credential to connect the application to the database instance.

## <a id='troubleshooting'></a> Troubleshooting

This procedure, including autowiring, was validated with a Spring Boot application. Autowiring did not work with a Ruby on Rails application, because the version of the MariaDB client library in the Cloud Foundry `cflinuxfs3` stack does not support `sslMode`.

* If your application cannot make SSL connections, start by properly consuming the connection information components and making a manual connection from the application.
* Some techniques for connecting non-Spring applications are provided in the [Activate TLS for Non-Spring Apps](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/2-10/using-tls.html#activate-non-spring) section of the MySQL for VMs documentation. The credentials hash created in the [Binding an Application](#binding-an-application) procedure above does not include individual components of connection information, such as `username` and `hostname`, but you can derive these components by parsing the `uri` in the hash.
* As a last resort, you can disable TLS on the MySQL instance and remove the `ssl_mode` and `sslMode` parameters from the credentials hash.
