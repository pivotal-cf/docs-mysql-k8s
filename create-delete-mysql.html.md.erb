This topic describes how you, as a developer, deploy and delete MySQL instances.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before you can create or delete MySQL instances, you must have:

[//]: # (This partial contains a standard set of prereqs. Also used in high-availability topic.)
<%= partial '/prerequisites' %>


## <a id='create-instance'></a>Create a MySQL Instance

[//]: # (Note to authors: if you change step numbers in this procedure, edit high-availability topic.)

To create a MySQL instance:

1. Target the namespace where you want to create the MySQL instance:

    ```
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=DEVELOPMENT-NAMESPACE
    ```
    Where `DEVELOPMENT-NAMESPACE` is the namespace in which you want to create the instance.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=my-namespace
    </pre>

2. From your namespace, Kubernetes must be able to access the registry
   that stores the <%= vars.product_short %> images.
   To allow this, create an imagePullSecret by running:

    ```
    kubectl --namespace=DEVELOPMENT-NAMESPACE create secret docker-registry tanzu-mysql-image-registry --docker-server=REGISTRY-SERVER-URL --docker-username=DOCKER-USERNAME --docker-password=DOCKER-PASSWORD
    ```
    Where:
    * `DEVELOPMENT-NAMESPACE` is the namespace in which you want to create the instance
    * `REGISTRY-SERVER-URL` is the <%= vars.product_network %> registry or the private registry configured for your environment
    * `DOCKER-USERNAME` and `DOCKER-PASSWORD` are the credentials used to pull images from the registry.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ kubectl create secret --namespace=my-namespace \
    docker-registry tanzu-mysql-image-registry  \
    --docker-server=https://registry.pivotal.io/ \
    --docker-username=sample-username  \
    --docker-password=sample-password

    secret/tanzu-mysql-image-registry created
    </pre>

3. Find the `mysql.yaml` deployment template that you downloaded
   in the **Tanzu MySQL Deployment Templates** TGZ file from <%= vars.product_network %>.
   For how to download deployment templates, see [Download the Resources](install-operator.html#download)
   in _Installing the Tanzu SQL for Kubernetes Operator_.

4. Create a copy of the `mysql.yaml` file and give it a unique name.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ cp ~/Downloads/tanzu-mysql-deployment-templates-1.0.0/samples/mysql.yaml testdb.yaml</pre>


5. Edit the file.
   For information about the properties that you can set for the MySQL resource,
   see [Property Reference for the MySQL Resource](property-reference-mysql.html).

6. Deploy a MySQL instance to Kubernetes by running:

    ```
    kubectl -n DEVELOPMENT-NAMESPACE apply -f FILENAME
    ```
    Where `FILENAME` is the name of the configuration file you created in Step 4 above.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ kubectl -n my-namespace apply -f testdb.yaml
    mysql.with.sql.tanzu.vmware.com/mysql-sample created
    </pre>


7. Verify that the instance was created successfully by running:

    ```
    kubectl -n DEVELOPMENT-NAMESPACE get mysql INSTANCE-NAME
    ```
    Where `INSTANCE-NAME` is the value that you configured for `metadata.name` in your file
    <br><br>
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ kubectl -n my-namespace get mysql mysql-sample
NAME           READY   STATUS    AGE
mysql-sample   true    Running   2m17s
    </pre>


## <a id='delete-instance'></a>Delete a MySQL Instance

This section provides some conceptual information about persistent volume claims (PVCs)
and deleting an instance.
It also provides the procedure for how to delete an instance.

###<a id="about-pvcs"></a> About PVCs

When you create a MySQL instance, the MySQL Operator also creates a persistent
volume claim (PVC).
This PVC is attached to the instance and contains the data for the MySQL database.

The PVC name contains the instance name and the MySQL Pod number.
Currently only one Pod is allowed per instance, so the PVC name is of the form
<code>mysql-data-INSTANCE-NAME-N</code>.
For example, <code>mysql-data-mysql-sample-0</code>

<p class="note">
   <strong>Note:</strong>
Currently only one Pod is allowed per instance, so <code>N</code> is always <code>0</code>.
</p>

###<a id="about-deleting"></a> About Deleting a MySQL Instance

There are two steps to deleting an instance.
The first step is to delete the instance itself, and the second step is to delete the PVC.

There are situations where you want to delete the instance but not delete the PVC.
For example, in a test environment, you might delete the instance to save costs
but keep the PVC storing the data.

If you later create a new instance with the same name as the deleted instance,
the old PVC automatically reattaches to the new instance and you have access to your data again.

<p class="note">
   <strong>Note:</strong> If you delete the Pod or the StatefulSet associated
   with the <%= vars.product_short %> resource,
   a <%= vars.product_short %> controller re-creates it for you.
   To permanently delete the instance, you need to delete the MySQL resource,
   as described in step 1 below.
</p>

###<a id="procedure"></a> Procedure

To delete a MySQL instance:

1. Delete the MySQL instance by running:

    ```
    kubectl -n DEVELOPMENT-NAMESPACE delete mysql INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    * `DEVELOPMENT-NAMESPACE` is the namespace where you created the instance.
    * `INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of the instance you want to delete.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ kubectl -n my-namespace delete mysql mysql-sample
    my-namespace "mysql-sample" deleted
    </pre>

2. (Optional) Delete the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).

    <p class="note warning">
       <strong> Warning:</strong> This is a destructive action.
       If you destroy your PVC, you delete all data associated with your <%= vars.product_short %> database.
    </p>

    1. Review your PVCs by running:

        ```
        kubectl get pvc
        ```

        For example:

        <pre class="terminal">
       $ kubectl get pvc
NAME                              STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
mysql-data-mysql-sample-0         Bound    pvc-3262e841-c4aa-4aa4-b53a-68cd3078f806   1Gi        RWO            standard       7d1h
mysql-data-another-sample-0       Bound    pvc-87c8a3a9-263b-46e6-8acb-ed474434fd24   1Gi        RWO            standard       6d21h</pre>

    2. Identify the names of the PVCs that correspond to the name of the instance you deleted above.

    3. Delete the PVC associated with each MySQL Pod by running, for each Pod:

        ```
        kubectl delete pvc mysql-data-INSTANCE-NAME-N
        ```

        Where:
        + `INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of the MySQL instance that you deleted above.
        + `N` is the index of each Pod in the MySQL instance.

        For example:

        <pre class="terminal">
       $ kubectl delete pvc mysql-data-mysql-sample-0
persistentvolumeclaim "mysql-data-mysql-sample-0" deleted</pre>
