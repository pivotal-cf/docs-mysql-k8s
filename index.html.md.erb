This topic provides an overview of <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>).

## <a id='about-mysql4k8s'></a>About <%= vars.product_short %>

<%= vars.product_short %> is a Kubernetes Operator that automates provisioning, management,
and operations of dedicated MySQL instances running on Kubernetes.
By default, MySQL instances provisioned by <%= vars.product_short %> are configured with
secure and functional settings to meet app developer expectations for a general-use relational
database.

Kubernetes Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that provide custom resources
for the management of apps, services, and their components.

The Operator provides a consistent way to deploy MySQL instances to Kubernetes and to run them.
This includes "day two", continuous operations.
Apps running on Kubernetes can use MySQL instances deployed using the Operator.

<%= vars.product_short %> packages a collection of open-source software to help you deploy
and manage one or more instances of the MySQL database on Kubernetes.
It includes the following components:

  * [Percona Server 8.0](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server)
  * [Percona XtraBackup 8.0](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup)


## <a id='about-mysql-8-0'></a>About MySQL 8.0

MySQL is a powerful open-source relational database in use since the mid-90s.
Developers have relied on MySQL as a first step to storing, processing, and sharing data.
As its user community has grown, MySQL has become a robust system
capable of handling a wide variety of use cases and very significant workloads.
Unlike other traditional databases that centralize and consolidate data,
MySQL lends itself to dedicated deployment, which supports building "cloud native" apps.
